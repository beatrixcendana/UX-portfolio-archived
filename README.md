# ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨ UX-portfolio-archived
This is the collection of my UX portfolio design and writing. I decided not to post it on my website due to the limited work I can show on the website.
These are the lists of my portfolio (archived):
- Collab Writing 
  Recruit more volunteers for a nonprofit organization that focused on social enterprise and social change.
  
- Agora Team Meeting (UW Protothon 2021)
  Help users experience a great virtual work collaboration by using features such as ice breaking, whiteboard, and AR features.
