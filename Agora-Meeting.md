## 🐚 OVERVIEW
We chose the enterprise track, and the topic is **'Innovation Beyond Video Conferencing'**.

We would build upon [**Agora**](https://www.agora.io/en/), a video conferencing company dedicated to making Real-Time Engagement ubiquitous, such as voice and live interactive streaming platforms. This organization allows everyone to develop and deliver rich in-app experiences — including embedded voice and video chat, real-time recording and messaging.

And here is our task:

    Your task is to think outside the box and design an enterprise Real Time Engagement mobile or web application that showcases how 
    Agora's video conferencing/voice.streaming/messaging solutions can be used.
