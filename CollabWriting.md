## 🐚 OVERVIEW
I took part in a UX project at Collab as a UX web writer. I focused on four pages, consisted of:

- Home page (Mission and Project Partners)
- The Program
- Footer
- Contact

I conducted a content audit and found a cluttered UI/UX design, grammatical errors, and too technical languages.

> How might we create a web content that can invite more than 80+ volunteers to sign up monthly?

## 🏠 Homepage
### Mission
Collab doesn't have mission on its home page. So, to give me a better understanding of what their mission is, I interviewed with the CEO and here is what I came with for the mission statement.

    “Collab is a joint collaboration between R1 and In Action. Our mission is to address the global challenges through 
    collaborative process and community service.”

## 📇 The Program
### Program can help the users understand company’s work progress.
Website is nothing without the program of the company.

- **Ending the Poverty (Before)**

  <br>
  
  **(After)**

  The goal is to fight against poverty through zero-subsidy affordable housing, food waste elimination, and potential benefit of crypto resources.

  By partnering with Foodie’s Foundation, our focus is to encourage restaurant owners to give the guests an option at the end of the meal to ‘box up’ the food leftovers for charity.

  **(After)**
  
  We are collaborating with the Biophilia team to figure out the potential ways of reducing the stress and anxiety. Our first idea is to build the vertical gardens in hospitals and libraries. The next goal is to identify how herbal medicine and healthy foods can contribute to promote healthy sleep, to strengthen immune system and to stabilize moods.
